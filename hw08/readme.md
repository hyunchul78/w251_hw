## Part 1 Questions:

1. In the time allowed, how many images did you annotate?

Total 31 image files for 10 minutes

2. Home many instances of the Millennium Falcon did you annotate? How many TIE Fighters?

Two Millenium falcon and around 5 TIE fighters

3. Based on this experience, how would you handle the annotation of large image data set?

This is very time consuming work. If project is well funded, outsourcing annotation is more practical. 

4. Think about image augmentation? How would augmentations such as flip, rotation, scale, cropping, and translation effect the annotations?

Image augmentation will make the learning more rigorous and network handle exceptional case.


## Part 2 

Questions: Describe the following augmentations in your own words

Flip : Vertically or horizontally flip images.
Rotation : Rotate the image by the specified amount. Positive angle is counter clock wise direction
Scale : Change the object size and crop
Crop : Crop the certain area and zoom to fit image to original size
Translation : move object to x or y direction by the specified amount. Fill the background with 
Noise : Add gaussian noise to image. The noise value is between zero and one. Blurring is also one of the augmentation option.


## Part 3 

Questions: Image annotations require the coordinates of the objects and their classes; in your option, what is needed for an audio annotation?


Ans: Start and end time of spectram and time domain wave signal together with label
